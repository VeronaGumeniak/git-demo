baby u light up my world likee nobody else
the way that u flip ur hair gets me overwhelmed
but when u smile at the groud it ain't hard to tell 
u don't know
u don't know u're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful

So c-come on
U got it wrong
to prove i'm righ i put it in a song
